The `Canvas` object is where you start to define your React Three Fiber Scene.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'

const App = () => (
  <Canvas>
    <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <mesh>
      <sphereBufferGeometry />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
    </mesh>
  </Canvas>
)
```

### Render defaults

Canvas uses the [render function](/react-three-fiber/API/render-function) which will create a translucent `THREE.WebGLRenderer` with the following constructor args:

- antialias=true
- alpha=true
- powerPreference="high-performance"

and with the following properties:

- outputEncoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding
- toneMapping = THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping

It will also create the following scene internals:

- A `THREE.Perspective` camera
- A `THREE.Orthographic` cam if `orthographic` is true
- A `THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap` if `shadows` is true
- A `THREE.Scene` (into which all the JSX is rendered) and a `THREE.Raycaster`

<Hint>

The colorspace will be set to sRGB (unless "linear" is true), all colors and textures will be
auto-converted. Consult [donmccurdy.com: Color Management in
three.js](https://www.donmccurdy.com/2020/06/17/color-management-in-threejs) for more information
about this. Unless "flat" is true it will set up `THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping` for slightly more
contrast.

<Hint>

Canvas creates a [resize observer](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-use-measure) to update the canvas size.

Consider Resize-Observer polyfills for older Safari browsers. We recommend
[juggle/resize-observer](https://github.com/juggle/resize-observer).
