<Intro>
  Build your scene declaratively with re-usable, self-contained components that react to state, are readily interactive and can participate in [React](https://react.dev)'s ecosystem.
</Intro>

[![React Three Fiber banner](../banner-r3f.jpg)](/getting-started/examples)

```bash
npm install three @types/three @react-three/fiber
```
> [!WARNING]  
> Three-fiber is a React renderer, it must pair with a major version of React, just like react-dom, react-native, etc. @react-three/fiber@8 pairs with react@18, @react-three/fiber@9 pairs with react@19.

## Does it have limitations?

None. Everything that works in Threejs will work here without exception.

## Is it slower than plain Threejs?

No. There is no overhead. Components render outside of React. It outperforms Threejs in scale due to React's scheduling abilities.

## Can it keep up with frequent feature updates to Threejs?

Yes. It merely expresses Threejs in JSX, `<mesh />` dynamically turns into `new THREE.Mesh()`. If a new Threejs version adds, removes or changes features, it will be available to you instantly without depending on updates to this library.

## What does it look like?

Let's make a re-usable component that has its own state, reacts to user-input and participates in the render-loop:

<Sandpack
  customSetup={{
    dependencies: {
      'react': 'latest',
      'react-dom': 'latest',
      'three': 'latest',
      '@react-three/fiber': 'latest'
    },
    entry: '/index.jsx',
  }}
  folder="basic-example-sandpack"
/>

      <meshStandardMaterial color={hovered ? 'hotpink' : '#2f74c0'} />
    </mesh>

    <ambientLight intensity={Math.PI / 2} />

For installation instructions see [react native installation instructions](/getting-started/installation#react-native).

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react'
import { Canvas, useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber/native'

function Box(props) {
  const meshRef = useRef(null)
  const [hovered, setHover] = useState(false)
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)
  useFrame((state, delta) => (meshRef.current.rotation.x += delta))

      onPointerOut={(event) => setHover(false)}>

## First steps

You need to be versed in both React and Threejs before rushing into this. If you are unsure about React consult the official [React docs](https://react.dev/learn), especially [the section about hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react). As for Threejs, make sure you at least glance over the following links:

1. Make sure you have a [basic grasp of Threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene). Keep that site open.
2. When you know what a scene is, a camera, mesh, geometry, material, fork the [demo above](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber#what-does-it-look-like).
3. [Look up](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh) the JSX elements that you see (mesh, ambientLight, etc), _all_ threejs exports are native to three-fiber.
4. Try changing some values, scroll through our [API](/api/canvas) to see what the various settings and hooks do.

Some helpful material:

- [Threejs-docs](https://threejs.org/docs) and [examples](https://threejs.org/examples)
- [Discover Threejs](https://discoverthreejs.com), especially the [Tips and Tricks](https://discoverthreejs.com/tips-and-tricks) chapter for best practices
- [Bruno Simons Threejs Journey](https://threejs-journey.com), arguably the best learning resource, now includes a full [R3F chapter](https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/what-are-react-and-react-three-fiber)
