description: Changes and new features with v9 and react 19

This release is a compatability release for React 19, which brings further performance, stability, and type improvements. You can check out the React 19 changelog [here](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19).

We would like to express our gratitude to the community for their continued support, as well as to all our contributors, including the React team at Meta and Vercel, for ensuring this upgrade went smoothly. 🎉

## Performance

// TODO: JSX, React Compiler (if not explicitly clear), react-native Hermes profile
// Also, PoC for improvements with OffscreenCanvas support

## Features

### useLoader Accepts Loader Instance

`useLoader` now supports re-use of external loader instances for more controlled pooling and setup.

```jsx
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/addons'
import { useLoader } from '@react-three/fiber'

function Model() {
  const gltf = useLoader(GLTFLoader, '/path/to/model.glb')
}

// or,

const loader = new GLTFLoader()
function Model() {
  const gltf = useLoader(loader, '/path/to/model.glb')
}
```

### Factory extend Signature

`extend` can now produce a component when a three.js class is passed to it individually instead of a catalog of named classes. This is backwards compatible and reduces TypeScript boilerplate and JSX collisions. We recommend libraries migrate to this signature so internal components don't clash with user-land declarations.

```tsx
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/addons'
import { type ThreeElement, type ThreeElements } from '@react-three/fiber'

declare module '@react-three/fiber' {
  interface ThreeElements {
    orbitControls: ThreeElement<typeof OrbitControls>
  }
}

extend({ OrbitControls })

<orbitControls args={[camera, gl.domElement]}>

// or,

const Controls = extend(OrbitControls)
<Controls args={[camera, gl.domElement]} />
```

## Fixes

### Color Management of Textures

Automatic sRGB conversion of texture props is removed, and color textures are handled automatically for known built-in materials. This aligns with vanilla three behavior and fixes hard-to-debug errors where data textures like normals or displacement are corrupted or made non-linear (math and interpolation must be done linearly). For custom materials or shaders, make sure to annotate color textures with `texture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace` or `texture-colorSpace={THREE.SRGBColorSpace}` with JSX.

For more details, see https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Color-management.

### Suspense and Side-Effects

Correctness and handling of `Suspense` and fallback content have improved between both React and R3F. Side-effects like `attach` and constructor side-effects (e.g., controls, which may add event listeners) will no longer fire repeatedly without cleanup while a tree is suspending. This required a major rearchitecture over the last 2 years and collaboration upstream to iterate towards a robust solution.

```jsx
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/addons'

extend({ OrbitControls })

function Controls() {
  const camera = useThree((state) => state.camera)
  const gl = useThree((state) => state.gl)

  // Will only initialize when tree is connected to screen
  return <orbitControls args={[camera, gl.domElement]}>
}

<Suspense>
  <Controls />
  <AsyncComponent />
</Suspense>
```

### Swapping with args and primitives

Internal handling of swapping elements when changing the `args` or primitive `object` prop has improved for structured children like an array or iterator (yes, React supports iterators and async iterators). Previously, primitives who shared an `object` could be updated out-of-order or removed from the scene along with their children.

```jsx
// ✅ Mounts a,b,c,d
[a, b, c, d].map((object, i) => <primitive key={i} object={object}>)

// ❌ Updates undefined,undefined,c,d
[d, c, b, a].map((object, i) => <primitive key={i} object={object}>)
```

## TypeScript Changes

### Props renamed to CanvasProps

Canvas `Props` is now called `CanvasProps` for clarity. These were aliased in v8 for forward compatibility, but `Props` is removed with v9.

```diff
-function Canvas(props: Props)
+function Canvas(props: CanvasProps)
```

### Dynamic JSX Types

Since R3F's creation, JSX types had to be maintained in accordance with additions to three core API. Although missing or future types could be ignored or resilient for forward and backwards compatibility, this was a major maintenance burden for us and those extending three. Furthermore, libraries which wrap or bind to the known catalog of elements (e.g. React Spring `<animated.mesh />`) had no way of knowing which elements belonged to a renderer.

Since v8, we've added a catalog of known elements to a `ThreeElements` interface, and with v9 automatically map three API to JSX types. As types are now dynamically mapped, hardcoded exports like `MeshProps` have been removed, and can be accessed as `ThreeElements['mesh']`. Helper types like `Color` or `Vector3` remain to reflect the JSX `MathType` API for shorthand expression.

```diff
-import { MeshProps } from '@react-three/fiber'
-type Props = MeshProps

+import { ThreeElements } from '@react-three/fiber'
+type Props = ThreeElements['mesh']
```

### Node Helpers

Specialized `Node` type helpers for extending JSX (`Node`, `Object3DNode`, `BufferGeometryNode`, `MaterialNode`, `LightNode`) are removed and combined into 'ThreeElement', which accepts a single type representing the extended element instance.

```tsx
import { type ThreeElement } from '@react-three/fiber'

declare module '@react-three/fiber' {
  interface ThreeElements {
    customElement: ThreeElement<typeof CustomElement>
  }
}
```

### ThreeElements

`ThreeElements` was added as an interface since v8.1.0 and is the current way of declaring or accessing JSX within R3F since React's depreciation of `global` JSX (see https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide#the-jsx-namespace-in-typescript). All JSX types belonging to R3F are accessible from `ThreeElements`.

```diff
-import { type Node } from '@react-three/fiber'
-declare global {
-  namespace JSX {
-    interface IntrinsicElements {
-      customElement: Node<CustomElement, typeof CustomElement>
-    }
-  }
-}

-import { type Node } from '@react-three/fiber'
-declare module '@react-three/fiber' {
-  interface ThreeElements {
-    customElement: Node<CustomElement, typeof CustomElement>
-  }
-}

+import { type ThreeElement } from '@react-three/fiber'
+declare module '@react-three/fiber' {
+  interface ThreeElements {
+    customElement: ThreeElement<typeof CustomElement>
+  }
+}
```

## Testing

### StrictMode

`StrictMode` is now correctly inherited from a parent renderer like react-dom. Previously, `<StrictMode />` mounted in another root such as react-dom would not affect the R3F canvas, so it had to be redeclared within the canvas as well.

```diff
<StrictMode>
  <Canvas>
-    <StrictMode>
-      // ...
-    </StrictMode>
+    // ...
  </Canvas>
</StrictMode>
```

### Act

`act` is now exported from React itself and can be used for all renderers. It will return the contents of a passed async callback like before and recursively flush async effects to synchronously test React output.

```tsx
import { act } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from '@react-three/fiber'

const store = await act(async () => createRoot(canvas).render(<App />))
console.log(store.getState())
```
