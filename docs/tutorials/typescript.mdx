This tutorial will assume some React and TypeScript knowledge. You can fork and follow along from [this starter codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/brnsm).

## Typing with useRef

React's `useRef` won't automatically infer types despite pointing it to a typed ref.

You can type the ref yourself by passing a type through `useRef`'s generics:

```tsx
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import { Mesh } from 'three'

function Box(props) {
  const meshRef = useRef<Mesh>(null!)

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(Boolean(meshRef.current))
  }, [])

  return (
    <mesh {...props} ref={meshRef}>
      <boxGeometry />
      <meshBasicMaterial />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

The exclamation mark is a non-null assertion that will let TS know that `ref.current` is defined when we access it in effects.

## Extend usage

react-three-fiber can also accept third-party elements and extend them into its internal catalogue.

```tsx
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import { GridHelper } from 'three'
import { extend } from '@react-three/fiber'

// Create our custom element
class CustomElement extends GridHelper {}

// Extend so the reconciler will learn about it
extend({ CustomElement })
```

The catalogue teaches the underlying reconciler how to create fibers for these elements and treat them within the scene.

You can then declaratively create custom elements with primitives, but TypeScript won't know about them nor their props.

```html
// error: 'customElement' does not exist on type 'JSX.IntrinsicElements'

<customElement />
```

### Extending ThreeElements

To define our element in JSX, we'll use the `ThreeElement` interface to extend `ThreeElements`. This interface describes three.js classes that are available in the R3F catalog and can be used as native elements.

```tsx
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import { GridHelper } from 'three'
import { extend, ThreeElement } from '@react-three/fiber'

// Create our custom element
class CustomElement extends GridHelper {}

// Extend so the reconciler will learn about it
extend({ CustomElement })

// Add types to ThreeElements elements so primitives pick up on it
declare module '@react-three/fiber' {
  interface ThreeElements {
    customElement: ThreeElement<typeof CustomElement>
  }
}

// react-three-fiber will create your custom component and TypeScript will understand it
;<customComponent />
```

## Exported types

react-three-fiber is extensible and exports types for its internals, such as render props, canvas props, and events:

```tsx
// Event raycaster intersection
Intersection

// `useFrame` internal subscription and render callback
Subscription
RenderCallback

// `useThree`'s returned internal state
RootState
Performance
Dpr
Size
Viewport
Camera

// Canvas props
Props

// Supported events
Events

// Event manager signature (is completely modular)
EventManager

// Wraps a platform event as it's passed through the event manager
ThreeEvent
```
