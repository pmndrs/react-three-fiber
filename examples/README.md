# Explore Examples

```bash
git clone https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber

# install project dependencies & build the library
cd react-three-fiber && yarn

# move to the examples folder & install dependencies 
cd examples && yarn

# start the dev server 
yarn start
```

After playing with the examples you can explore the src code. Each example URL maps to a file name in the `examples/src/demos` folder.
